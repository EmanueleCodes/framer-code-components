Unrolling Image - Property Controls

Preview
When enabled, shows the unrolling animation in the Framer canvas. When disabled, displays the fully unrolled image without animation.

Image
The image to apply the unrolling effect to. Click to select an image from your assets or upload a new one.

Angle
Controls the angle at which the image unrolls. Higher values create a more diagonal unroll effect. Lower values create a more horizontal unroll.

Rolls
Controls the number of complete rolls in the paper effect. Higher values create more tightly wound rolls with more spiral turns. Lower values create looser, fewer rolls.

Roll Radius
Controls the size of the roll radius. Higher values create thicker, more pronounced rolls. Lower values create thinner, more subtle rolls.

Animation - Trigger
Controls when the animation starts. "Appear" triggers the animation when the component first appears on screen. "Layer in View" triggers the animation when the component enters the viewport during scroll.

Animation - Start At
Controls the alignment point for scroll-based triggers. Determines which part of the component (top, center, or bottom) must enter the viewport to start the animation. Only visible when Trigger is set to "Layer in View".

Animation - Duration
Controls how long the unrolling animation takes to complete. Higher values create slower, more dramatic unrolls. Lower values create faster, snappier animations.

Animation - Delay
Controls the delay before the animation starts. Only visible when Trigger is set to "Appear".

Animation - Replay
When enabled, the animation will replay when scrolling back into view. When disabled, the animation plays only once. Only visible when Trigger is set to "Layer in View".
