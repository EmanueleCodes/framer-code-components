**PROPERTY CONTROLS**

**Preview**
Toggle animations on or off. When enabled, the laser will animate; when disabled, it shows a still frame.

**Fade In**
Controls how long it takes (in seconds) for the laser to fully appear when the component loads. Set to 0 for instant appearance.

**Color**
Sets the color of the laser beam. You can use hex colors (like #FF79C6), RGB/RGBA values, or Framer's color tokens.

**Background**
Adds a color behind the laser. Leave this empty for a transparent background, or choose a color to fill the area behind the beam.

**Beam X**
Moves the laser horizontally (left or right) within the component.

**Beam Y**
Moves the laser vertically (up or down) within the component.

**Height**
Controls the vertical size of the laser - make it taller or shorter.

**Width**
Controls the horizontal size of the laser - make it wider or narrower.

**Dynamics**
Controls the movement and flow characteristics of the laser.

  **Speed**
  How fast the light travels upward along the beam.

  **Strength**
  Controls how much the light intensity varies along the beam - higher values create more dramatic variations.

**Fog**
Adds a smoky, atmospheric effect around the laser.

  **Intensity**
  How bright and visible the fog appears. Higher values make the fog more prominent.

  **Scale**
  Controls the size of the fog patterns. Smaller values create finer details, larger values create broader patterns.

  **Fall**
  How fast the fog moves downward, creating a sense of gravity or wind.

**Wisps**
Adds glowing particles that move along the laser beam.

  **Density**
  Controls how many particles appear along the beam. 0 = none, 2 = maximum density.

  **Speed**
  How fast the particles move upward along the laser.

  **Intensity**
  Controls how bright the particles are. Higher values make them shine brighter.
