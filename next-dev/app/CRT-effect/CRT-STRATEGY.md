# CRT Effect Component Strategy

## Overview
Convert the VFX-JS CRT effect into a Framer code component that can be placed on top of content to create a CRT monitor distortion effect.

## About the Texture

**Important**: The `texture(src, uv)` in the original code is NOT a downloadable texture file. It's dynamically generated by VFX-JS library, which:
1. Captures the rendered DOM content as a texture
2. Passes it to the shader as `uniform sampler2D src`
3. The shader then reads from this captured texture to distort it

**You cannot download this texture** - it's the live page content that VFX-JS captures automatically.

## Key Challenge
The original code uses `texture(src, uv)` to read from the source content. In Framer, we cannot directly capture what's rendered below our component. 

## Solution Approach

### Option 1: Visual Overlay (Recommended)
Create a WebGL overlay that generates CRT-style visual effects:
- **Scanlines**: Animated horizontal lines
- **Chromatic Aberration**: RGB color separation overlay
- **Vignette**: Dark edges
- **Distortion Patterns**: Screen curvature simulation
- **Noise/Dither**: Static grain effect

**Pros:**
- Works in Framer's architecture
- Lightweight and performant
- Full control over effect intensity

**Cons:**
- Doesn't actually distort the content below (just adds overlay effects)
- Content shows through via transparency/blend modes

### Option 2: CSS Filter Approach (Limited)
Use CSS `backdrop-filter` combined with canvas overlays.

**Cons:**
- Limited shader capabilities
- Not as flexible as WebGL

## Implementation Strategy

### Component Structure
1. **Full-screen canvas overlay** that fills the component bounds
2. **WebGL shader** that generates CRT effects
3. **Transparent/Additive blending** so content shows through
4. **Property controls** for effect intensity

### Shader Adaptation
The original shader reads from `texture(src, uv)`. We'll adapt it to:
- Generate procedural CRT effects instead of reading textures
- Use UV coordinates for distortion patterns
- Apply effects as overlays that can be composited

### Key Features to Implement
1. **Preview Control** (first prop, following Framer patterns)
2. **Effect Intensity** - Overall strength of CRT effect
3. **Scanline Intensity** - How visible the scanlines are
4. **Chromatic Aberration** - RGB separation amount
5. **Vignette Strength** - Edge darkening
6. **Distortion Amount** - Screen curvature simulation
7. **Noise Amount** - Static grain
8. **Speed** - Animation speed

### Technical Implementation
- Use Three.js (via CDN) for WebGL rendering
- Follow patterns from `ShaderLines.tsx` and `wavePrism.tsx`
- Use refs for live prop updates
- Implement canvas resize detection
- Frame-rate independent animations using delta time

## Component Placement
User places the component:
- **On top** of their content in Framer canvas
- Set to full width/height of the frame
- Uses `mix-blend-mode` or transparency to composite with content below

## Next Steps
1. Create component structure following Framer University patterns
2. Adapt the main shader from CRT-Reference.js for overlay approach
3. Implement property controls
4. Test in canvas and live preview modes
