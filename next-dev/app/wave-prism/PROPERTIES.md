Wave Prism - Property Controls

Preview
Shows or hides the animation while editing in Framer. Turn it off when you're positioning the component to save performance.

Speed
Controls how fast the wave moves horizontally. Lower values create a slower drift, higher values make it move quickly.

Thickness
Adjusts how thick the light beams appear. Lower values create thin, delicate beams while higher values make them thicker and more prominent.

Distortion
Controls the chromatic aberration effect where colors split apart. At 0, all colors align perfectly. Higher values create more color separation and a prism-like rainbow effect.

Frequency
Sets how many wave peaks appear across the width. Lower values create gentle, wide waves while higher values add more oscillations.

Amplitude
Controls how tall the waves are (vertical height of the oscillation). Lower values create subtle waves, higher values make dramatic curves.

Glow
Adjusts the intensity of the glowing halo around the beams. Set to 0 for sharp beams with no glow, or 1 for maximum soft glow effect.

Background
Choose a background color for the component. Leave it empty for a transparent background so content behind it shows through.
