Exploding Tap - Property Controls

Preview
When enabled, automatically spawns particles in the Framer canvas to preview the effect without user interaction.

Mode
Sets the content type for particles: Components (uses component instances) or Images (uses image assets).

Content
Add component instances that will be used as particles when they spawn. Only visible in Components mode.

Count
Sets how many different images will be used as particles. Only visible in Images mode.

Image 1-10
Add images to use as particles. Each image slot appears based on the Count setting. Only visible in Images mode.

Width
Controls the width of image particles in pixels. Only visible in Images mode.

Height
Controls the height of image particles in pixels. Only visible in Images mode.

Amount
Sets how many particles spawn when you click or tap the component.

Scale
Controls the size of particles when they spawn.

Scale
Sets the base size multiplier for all particles. Values below 1 make particles smaller, above 1 make them larger.

Randomize
When enabled, allows particles to have varying sizes instead of a uniform scale.

Variation
Controls how much particle sizes can vary from the base scale, as a percentage. Only visible when Randomize is enabled.

Rotation
Controls particle rotation behavior.

Rotation
Sets the initial rotation angle of particles in degrees.

Animate
When enabled, particles will rotate as they move. Without animation, particles maintain their initial rotation.

Direction
Controls which direction particles fly when spawned.

Horizontal
Sets the horizontal launch direction: left (←), center (•), or right (→).

Vertical
Sets the vertical launch direction: top (↑), center (•), or bottom (↓).

Speed
Controls how fast particles move after spawning. Higher values create faster movement.

Randomness
Controls how much random variation is added to particle trajectories. Higher values create more chaotic, spread-out patterns.

Gravity
Controls the gravitational force affecting particles. Positive values pull particles down, negative values pull them up. At 0, particles move in straight lines.

Duration
Sets how long particles remain visible before fading out, measured in seconds.
