Distance
Controls the intensity of the glass shard displacement effect. Higher values create more dramatic separation between glass fragments. Lower values create a more subtle effect.

Edge
Controls the thickness of the crack lines and glass fragment edges. Higher values create thicker, more visible cracks. Lower values create thinner, more delicate fracture lines.
